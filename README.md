# SexesByStephanie Website

![homepage screenshot](/src/assets/website-screenshot.png)

This is an e-commerce I'm currently building for a client who runs her own clothing line called Sexes. I'm still in the process of building the site out, but most of the shopping features are complete. The site will also act as a promo for her other offered services.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Redux
- Material UI
- CommerceJS (e-commerce platform) \*\* likely to change

## Notes

- Will more than likely be switching e-commerce platform to Shopify.
  - Noticed after the fact that CommerceJS's platform does not offer an ideal authentication API. It doesn't take a user password as a parameter and that's not something I'll willing to work around. (3/23/21)
- Will be adding a services page that displays the other 3 services the client offers. In the process of getting approval on the design now. (3/23/21)
