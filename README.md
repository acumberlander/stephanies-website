# SexesByStephanie Website

This is an e-commerce I'm currently building for a client who runs her own clothing line called Sexes. I'm still in the process of building the site out, but most of the shopping features are complete. The site will also act as a promo for her other offered services.

## Tech Stack

- React
- Redux
- Material UI
- CommerceJS (e-commerce platform)

## Notes

- Might be switching the e-commerce platform to Shopify.
  - Noticed after the fact that CommerceJS's platform does not offer an ideal authentication API. It doesn't take a user password as a parameter and that's not something I'll willing to work around. (3/23/21)
  - **UPDATE** -- Client has expressed that she doesn't care to have a login feature for her app because she doesn't feel it's of much use to her business. Her products are one of a kind, so the customer doesn't really need to see their order history because they typically wouldn't be able to buy more of that same item, plus in a way it would be redundant since a receipt will be emailed to the customer after each purchase. Also, CommerceJS keeps up with all of the order and customer data, so it's not really necessary in the long run. (3/24/21)
- Services page was recently added. There are some responsiveness bugs that need to be fixed. (3/24/21)
